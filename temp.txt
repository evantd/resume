## Key Observations

- Evan demonstrated technical leadership in both process reflection (Slack) and technical implementation (Jira/GitLab).
- Collaboration was both within-team (planning, troubleshooting) and cross-team (public channels, technical support).
- Most technical work was self-driven, with some peer review and collaborative decision-making (notably with Eric Weinberger).
- No meetings or document collaborations were recorded for this date.
- Evidence of mentoring and peer support, especially in public channels and technical troubleshooting.
