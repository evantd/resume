   - Identify themes consistent with current resume style
   - Note technical skills, leadership growth, and impact metrics
   - Track role transitions and responsibilities over time

2. **Map timeline to current resume structure**
   - Current resume covers Aug 2015 - April 2019 (3.5 years)
   - Reviews cover 2016-2024 (8+ years) 
   - Identify overlaps and new content periods
   - Understand role progression: SE → Senior SE → Tech Lead → Manager → Staff SE

### Phase 2: Content Development
3. **Extract and organize achievements by role/time period**
   - Software Engineer (2015-2016): existing content + 2016 reviews

   - Manager/TDM (2017-2019): enhance with 2017-2019 reviews

   - Check for appropriate level of detail
   - Maintain professional tone and structure
