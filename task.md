This repo contains my resume/CV at resume.md and the performance reviews from my last 10 years at Indeed in indeed-evals.
Reviews varied between happening quartely and happening every 6 months, so when a quarter is missing, that's because the next review covers 6 months.
Quarter number also shifted from calendar quarters to fiscal quarters starting in 2023, so 2023-Q0 was Jaunary through March.
I want to update/rewrite the Indeed portion of my resume/CV based on these performance reviews.
You're encouraged to ask clarifying questions whenever it would be helpful and `git commit` often if you iterate on changes.
Let's start with any clarifying questions, then write a step-by-step plan to plan.md and ask for feedback.
