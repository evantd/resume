1: This repo contains my resume/CV at resume.md and the performance reviews from my last 10 years at Indeed in indeed-evals.
2: Reviews varied between happening quartely and happening every 6 months, so when a quarter is missing, that's because the next review covers 6 months.
3: Quarter number also shifted from calendar quarters to fiscal quarters starting in 2023, so 2023-Q0 was Jaunary through March.
4: I want to update/rewrite the Indeed portion of my resume/CV based on these performance reviews.
5: You're encouraged to ask clarifying questions whenever it would be helpful and `git commit` often if you iterate on changes.
6: Let's start with any clarifying questions, then write a step-by-step plan to plan.md and ask for feedback.

## Clarifications:
- **Scope**: Edit the Indeed section rather than rewriting it.
- **Focus**: Emphasize the same themes as are found in the existing resume.md.
- **Format**: Keep the style consistent with the existing content. Length can expand proportionally. Since we're adding about 3 years to the existing 7 years, we can expand the content by about 50%. Err on the side of including too much, since we can always edit it down later.
- **Confidentiality**: There may be sensitive details in the reviews, and internal names for things that won't be understood by people outside Indeed, so we should explain things a little bit generically. Ask how to describe things when internal codenames are used.
- **Timeline**: Balance recent accomplishments with showing progression over the full ten years.
