Evan is a SWE3 in the UI Platform Web US space, operating as a staff IC. This cycle, his first since his paternity leave, Evan started by driving explorations into our platform upgrade strategy for Mosaic Hosts and Providers. He then supported our IFL6 UXD workstream and React 18 efforts, and ideating new sitespeed improvements. {Add 80% note}

### Support a Viable React 18 and IFL 6 Rollout

Evan supported both the React 18 and IFL 6 upgrades directly and indirectly. For React 18, Evan advocated for the React upgrade from a sitespeed perspective, as well as [identifying the work for React 18](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/179Kx2nSBvFeU7-4EmRMtDbGmlPE3g58edkC8vIj7M2s/edit) before paternity leave.

* Created the new sharedScope ([MOSPLAT-3739](https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/MOSPLAT-3739)) and made sure it worked by upgrading GlobalNav ([GNAV-1221](https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/GNAV-1221))  
* (Pre-leave) Created the initial concurrent rendering spike ([MOSPLAT-3302](https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/MOSPLAT-3302)) that proved sitespeed impact of React 18  
* (Pre-leave) [Plotted and centralized](https://docs.google.com/document/d/179Kx2nSBvFeU7-4EmRMtDbGmlPE3g58edkC8vIj7M2s/edit#heading=h.py3tgi5skk4) our upgrade strategies for (among other things) React 18 as a team and platform  
* Supported and paired with [Eric Weinberger](mailto:eweinberger@indeed.com)’s IFL 6 work for UXD workstream  
* [Eric Weinberger](mailto:eweinberger@indeed.com): “His collaboration has been essential to my effectiveness this last quarter.”

### Pseudo-Technical Product Owner for web \#sitespeed

Evan has historically been our authority on sitespeed related topics, and this cycle saw Evan identify, prioritize, and execute on our 2024 sitespeed opportunities.

* Extensive investigation and analysis created the [2024 SiteSpeed Opportunities](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1r7IxWmRVGRibdBcShTOFR3xRC5SFC0vdExhEFPq1vvM/edit) document, which forms our sitespeed roadmap  
  * This drove the T3’s [Sitespeed OKR contributions](https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/JSRCH-13529)  
* [MOSAIC-544](https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/MOSAIC-544): shared-deps event loop turning ([TestStats](https://teststats.sandbox.indeed.net/mosaic_platform_shared_deps_turn_tst?selectedAllocName=A))  
  * Improvements to WW sitespeed (Mob Home: \+1.52%, Mob View Job: \+0.40%, Mob Search: \+0.52%, overall \+0.68%)  
  * This sitespeed improvement led to a corresponding rise in Homepage Job Clicks (+0.34%) as well as Apply Starts (+0.23%), Sponsored Job Apply Starts (+0.28%), and Total Indeed Applies (+0.31%)  
  * [Keith Loy](mailto:kloy@indeed.com): “This project required careful planning and execution, and Evan's dedication and attention to detail were evident throughout the process.”  
* [MOBILE-44269](https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/MOBILE-44269): Worked with Marketing to determine that the Google DCM Marketing tag was no longer needed on mobile serp, led to 1-3% improvements to sitespeed ([US TestStats](https://teststats.sandbox.indeed.net/mobdcmtst?selectedAllocName=B&base=mobdcmtst1) [RoW TestStats](https://teststats.sandbox.indeed.net/mobdcmtst?selectedAllocName=A&base=mobdcmtst2))

### Spike Mosaic Platform Upgrade Strategy

Evan’s first big effort upon returning was to explore the complex relationship that Mosaic the platform has with our Hosts and Providers, and specifically how best to support them during large-scale dependency upgrades. While our recent plans to utilize monorepos to centralize much of this sprawl excludes much of this planning, those decisions were influenced and informed by this effort, its [accompanying report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpuIsZApjzfuIlUthaPoC0mQLdJ205_GGNyNMaVgON0/edit), and the discussion within.

### Support efforts at the T4 and above Level

This cycle Evan expanded his representation at other layers of the organization, as well as a greater awareness and influence of team status and health beyond his own efforts.

* UI Platform Web US representative in the Journey tech leads sync ([notes doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_kru92kuspKqH0Qf5qYfGMKP4mwTn88CWwWg12zBjI/edit))  
* Main point-of-contact for VM2 security vulnerability

* [Daniel Poindexter](mailto:dpoindexter@indeed.com): “I've observed that you've gotten much more involved in team strategy, in a really positive way.”
