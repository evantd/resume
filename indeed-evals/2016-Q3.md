## **exec+ Integration of Immutable Requirements with Dradis**

This is a prerequisite for launching the improved Experience Screener Question.

* [Modified Dradis](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DRAW-10524) to use new Immutable backend API  
* Enhanced new API to [delete duplicate requirements](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-585) in old data on writes  
* Improved [logging](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-495) for [validation errors](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-537)  
* [Refactored indexing](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-505) to support new API  
* [Delete obsolete API methods](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=key%20in%20\(NIGMA-480%2CNIGMA-553%29)  
* init+ [Remove Protest and old code paths](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DRAW-10846) in Dradis

## **impact+ Improved Experience Screener Question**

* Switched from asking "Do you have 3 years of Java experience?" to "How many years of Java experience do you have?", which allows for more opportunities to prefill jobseeker answers, which is a better user experience and improves job apply completions  
* [Prefill rate improves](https://go.indeed.com/IQL89N2NF) by \~1.5% per month for YesNo to \~4.4% per week with ExpYears

## **init+ Deleted All Remaining Hand-coded Mongo Marshallers and Unmarshallers**

* Switched from hand-coded routines to [Spring Data MongoDB](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=key%20in%20\(NIGMA-477%2CNIGMA-481%2CNIGMA-483%2CNIGMA-487%2CNIGMA-488%2CNIGMA-489%2CNIGMA-490%2CNIGMA-575%2CNIGMA-587%29) \-- makes it so we don't have to modify marshallers and unmarshallers as the Mongo document schema evolves.

## **Sort Candidates Based on Answer Quality**

* Worked with Dradis team to [spec out backend requirements](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DRADIS-595) for new employer dashboard view of candidates  
* Implemented [Screener Question service call](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=key%20in%20\(NIGMA-430%2CNIGMA-524%2CNIGMA-525%29) to support this

## **Miscellaneous**

* init+ [Improve prefills for high school education level](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-507) \-- better matching of high school information in resumes, leading to higher prefill rates  
* init+ [upgrade to indeed platform v4](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-516) (featuring Spring 4\)  
* init+ [Make WildcardBinder fall back to string](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/LEILA-287) when parsing other types fails: Found & fixed a bug in Leila that was causing our index builders to fail when presented with certain kinds of poison-pill data.  
* init+ [Upgrade to latest Mongo Client](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-526) \-- Enables us to move to Mongo 3.2 and its join feature as soon as it's available from OPs.  
* impact+ exec+ Highly valued [code reviewer](https://fisheye.indeed.com/cru/commentSearch?search.projectId=none&search.text=&search.permaId=&search.period.fromStr=2016-06-16T00%3A00%3A00&search.period.toStr=2016-09-16T00%3A00%3A00&search.authorName=edower&search.metric=&search.metric=&refresh=y)

## **impact+ Spring Subject Matter Expert**

* Advised a variety of teams on their Spring usage, including:  
  * GoodTimes  
  * RezSearch  
  * RezRecos

## **Interviewing**

* 5 Whiteboard shadows  
* 1 Whiteboard lead

#### **Next Steps**

* Blog on the benefits of Spring Data MongoDB  
* Mentor new IU grad that joins Screener Questions in Q4  
* Become a Whiteboard interview lead

#### **Career Focus**

* Take on more of a leadership role in working with your Prod Mgr and TDM in setting the team direction

#### **Overall Rating**

Exceeds Expectations
