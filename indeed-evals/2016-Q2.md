#### **Summary**

While delivering strong contributions across the org, has been less focused on driving key Screener Question initiatives.

#### **Justification**

**MongoDB \+ Spring**

* Used [Spring for Mongo Document deserialization](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-265). This makes it easy to localize the impact of future invented requirements.  
* {init+} [Documented](https://wiki.indeed.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75704577) how other teams can do the same thing

**Years of Experience Question**

Rather than ask "Do you have 3 years of Java experience?", ask "How many years of Java experience do you have?" to increase autofill of job seeker answers. This work was started in Q1.

* [Updated DRADIS](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DRAW-9127) to use this new feature.  
* {init+} [Removed obsolete DRADIS code](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DRAW-9388) near this feature.  
* [Revised Dradis](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DRAW-10242) to call new Screener Question setRequirements API.

**New Translations of Experience Question**

Screener Question team has reworded the experience question and this required translation. Evan focused on improving the translation process as part of this effort.

* Created explosion tickets for [Screener Questions](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-418) and [DRADIS](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DRAW-9970).  
* {impact+}, {init+} [Moved Screener Questions](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-436) into the [translation-as-an-artifact](https://wiki.indeed.com/display/ZOO/Developer+How+To+-+Enabling+translations+as+an+artifact+in+your+project) pilot program. This made a huge difference in translation time, bringing our "percent of translations completed within 3 days" up from 3% before the change to 100% after the change.  
* {init+} [Removed formatting markup from 'po' files](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-442) to make them easier to translate.

**Seattle Spring Expert**

Evan is the Spring upgrade point-person for Seattle

* {exec+}, {init+} Contributed to dozens of CRs for products all over the company, to help with their Spring issues.  
* [Improved](https://code.corp.indeed.com/pitz/auto-upgrade/merge_requests/1/commits) Jeremy Pitzeruse's 'auto-upgrade' script  
* [Split Nigma client library into its own repo](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-389), since the Nigma service already uses Spring 4, and not doing this risks accidently upgrading client Spring versions.  
* Consulted on [MATCH-40](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/MATCH-40) for his Spring expertise, to verify that Spring's '@Profile' feature was being used correctly. Quoting from peer:

"I worked with Evan on a Spring-centric code review with the Match product and discussed the Spring Data model approach with Mongo. Evan provided great insight on the Spring features and even provided insights on how I could improve our integration test setup. This insight greatly simplified our test logic and made everything more clear and concise."

**Other Improvements**

* {init+} [Fixed 'create-planning-releases.py'](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/ENV-5) in java-dev to work in the presence of manually created fixVersions.

* {init+} Discovered bug with Docker and our default desktop Linux kernel. Wrote [blog post](https://wiki.indeed.com/display/eng/2016/04/22/Prevent+desktop+freezing) on how to get around this.

**Interviews**

* 6 ADA interviews  
* 3 whiteboard shadows

**Peer Feedback**

"Evan is very detail oriented and thorough. When Evan puts out a feature for review, I'm confident that he has tested it end to end and everything works. I really appreciate this in a developer. This attention to detail translates to code reviews as well, where I always find his feedback helpful and constructive."

#### **Next Steps**

* Strike a better balance between infrastructure work and direct customer impact  
* Deliver on Q3 high value Screener Question initiatives  
* Continue to coach and share your Spring expertise with other teams  
* Write a blog on Spring Data MongoDB  
* Become a whiteboard interview lead

#### **Career Focus**

* Strive for greater impact on product planning

#### **Overall Rating**

Meets Expectations
