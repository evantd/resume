### Next Steps / Career Growth

Evan, you've had a strong cycle, performing the work that enabled the team to deliver major initiatives (UI Split / Platform Upgrades). In a period marked by shifting priorities and the absence of a TDM, you demonstrated resilience and technical leadership, helping the team stay focused and execute successfully. Your contributions were a key reason we were able to meet nearly all of our OKRs, despite reduced staffing.

I'm excited to continue partnering with you as my technical counterpart on the team. As you continue to grow and evolve in your role, here are a few areas where I think you can have an even greater impact:

* **Mentoring Eric:** You've already built a strong, informal mentor/mentee relationship with Eric through your collaboration on platform upgrades. The next step is to formalize this mentorship—consider setting up regular weekly check-ins and working with him to develop a structured learning plan. Eric has shared that he's feeling a bit uncertain about his transition to SWE, but he’s confident that with your guidance, he can ramp up quickly and effectively.  
* **Career Development:**  Let’s work together to align on a clear career growth plan that reflects your goals and aspirations. I want to support you stepping into more leadership opportunities as they emerge within the team.  
* **Strategic Partnership with TDM:** Continue building your partnership with the TDM by helping articulate the strategic importance of the products we support. Your technical insight can play a critical role in shaping the future direction of the MAP team, particularly as we evaluate trade-offs and prioritize initiatives.  
* **Exploring React Native:** There’s an exciting chance to expand your impact by exploring React Native. If we’re able to prototype RN for Mosaic providers in a way that supports rendering across web and mobile platforms, it could be transformational. Your involvement in this space could help drive a major leap forward in cross-platform development.  Keep this in mind as we try to build [React Native expertise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WOCeOaxR6iIdp1wfoFHKneRJRbO0d5kGdLKiniCo6Ng/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.i3hz0uv2uocl) on the team this upcoming cycle.
