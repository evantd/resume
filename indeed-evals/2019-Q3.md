#### **Justification**

Team Overview: The Orca team is part of the Front-End Core org. Our focus in Q1 and Q2 2019, was the build out the Mosaic platform. Our focus changed in Q3 to build a tool called the Mosaic Console, to provide customers visibility into the Mosaic ecosystem. At the end of August, the team switched to working on the Global Navigation project, augmenting to the Global Navigation team in Austin.

Composition: 1xSWE1, 2xSWE2, 1xSWE3

Goals: [Mosaic Console](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJBm6ql6Xf8d7tgsMj3NQmhV0eFXCNffhoHZzh94_mY/edit), [Global Navigation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXrqLov9tibzzT4eN4VJVu62VhoLNsRI2NQ7HUAeRO8/edit#gid=0).

## **Assist with the Global Navigation OKRs exec+**

Global Navigation is a project aimed at providing a consistent navigation bar and footer experience across Indeed. His work included ramping up on the GNav codebases and architecture. Evan's key contributions to this project are:

* Modified Inbox UI to integrate GNav Header [INBOXW-1052](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/INBOXW-1052)  
* Fixed list item structure in mobile homepage footer [GNAVS-1289](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-1289). This issue improved accessibility of the GNav footer and was part of the [Q3 Hurley report issues](https://go.indeed.com/GLY2N24P9) to mitigate lawsuits.  
* Built a variant of the GNav header for employer marketing pages [GNAVS-1207](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-1207)  
* Assisted teammate with a ticket [JASX-34312](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/JASX-34312)  
  * High Five *"For your debugging and problem solving help in creating that worldwide servlet to get gnav to render on the worldwide endpoint\!"* \- SWE1  
* Improved developer experience for the GNav Components repo by getting npm-start to work  
  * High Five *"For getting the npm run start command to build gnav components locally. I have been using it non stop this week with all my component work...a great investment in saving development and testing time. Thank you\!‚Äù* \- SWE1  
* **Impact:** Evan worked on tickets that enabled rolling out GNav on more pages

## **Build out an MVP for the Mosaic Console**

Mosaic Console is a tool intended to provide visibility into the Mosaic ecosystem. This tool was being built from the ground up and was conceived towards the end of Q2 2019\.

* Built features to display information deemed useful to users from user studies [8 tickets](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=id%20in%20%28MOSCON-48%2C%20MOSCON-45%2C%20MOSCON-147%2C%20MOSCON-139%2C%20MOSCON-173%2C%20MOSCON-150%2C%20MOSCON-170%2C%20MOSCON-172%29%20ORDER%20BY%20project%2C%20key)  
* Established good patterns in codebase through [implementation of code splitting](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/MOSCON-38), [auto-building of commits to feature branches](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/MOSCON-30), and [persisting query results across sessions](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/MOSCON-56)  
* Influenced product direction by suggesting lightweight integration (adding links to existing tools instead of deep integration) stories

## **Miscellaneous init+**

* 11 architecture interviews (Gen SWE and Frontend SWE)  
* 170 code review comments  
* init+ impact+ Assisted with a security issue affecting the Mosaic platform [MOSPLAT-619](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/MOSPLAT-619)  
  * "*Evan met with me multiple times to discuss the issue, and suggested multiple fixes..upon publishing a version of the libraries with the fix, he caught a bug that would have affected multiple providers.*" \- SWE3  
* init+ Helped previous team resolve 2 issues [NIGMA-5255](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-5255), [NIGMA-5442](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-5442)  
  * *"While Evan rolled off IQ in Q1, he's been responsive to requests for his expertise and feedback over the past six months...I believe that the way he responds and interacts exemplifies the way great engineers can contribute"* \- Product Manager  
* init+ Gave a talk at the Lunch & Learn sessions organized by a SWE on the Jobseeker Profile team  
  * "..wanted to thank him for contributing to the MyIndeed Lunch and Learns, his talk on loading skeletons was interesting, pragmatic and I hope we'll be able to incorporate his ideas.." \- SWE3  
* Provides guidance and support to other SWEs on the team  
  * *"Evan has become my unofficial mentor this quarter and I am extremely grateful for the support, guidance and help he has consistently offered me"* \- SWE1  
  * *"Evan often would sit down with me to debug gnarly Java/Spring issues as they arose whether or not the thing I was working on was related to his work, and often unblocked my progress"* \- SWE2

#### **Next Steps**

Establish mechanisms so that you can provide technical direction for the team, help prioritize the team's work, and provide mentorship to your teammates, while you are working remotely.

#### **Career Focus**

Indeed expects engineers to demonstrate product sense. By this, I mean speaking up if/when product is setting goals that are irrelevant or incorrect. You missed an opportunity to do this in Q3. I'd like to see you collaborate closely with product on planning activities such as goal/OKR setting and roadmap planning.
