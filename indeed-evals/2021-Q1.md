Enables more incremental delivery ([\~4x](https://go.indeed.com/GLYCMC666) weekly deploys) and streamlines external contributions  
  * *"Your contributions to team delivery process have played a big part in reducing the difficulty of integrating Gnav changes and getting us to push on green." \-TF4*  
  * *"He played a large part in identifying what work needed to be done to improve the reliability of our test and deploy pipelines in support of push on green deploys." \-SWE2*  
* **Team: Completed and started testing the new Aurora-themed Job Seeker header**. Key part of achieving the *One Brand, One Design* Job Seeker mandate ([GNAV-683](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAV-683))  
* Super Bowl Ad. Assisted in capacity planning for team's services. Everything went smoothly\!

## **Team Impact init+**

Used as measurement for JS T1 KR  
* **Launched the new** [**globalDwellTime**](https://alexandria.sandbox.indeed.net/index/globalDwellTime) **index.** GNav now logs dwell time for all pages where it's enabled, giving product owners visibility into how much time users are spending on their pages  
* Delivered new in-product variant of the [Global Footer](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAV-463) (pending integrations)  
* Delivered new "Lite" GNav headers for use in branding funnel-like screens while minimizing potential distractions (pending integrations)

## **Impact Through Customers (team)**

* **Homepage feed**: Mosaic platform used to delivery ranked, non-job content. Increases in [click-through rates & content engagement](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zzDLzYUBsPzIdatX09YHRnmqe47rzny3dHF8KLbxYeI/edit?ts=605035a8#slide=id.gc8d62948fd_24_0).  
  * Mirrorball ranking led to **\+8.6% CTR** w/ increases in applystarts. Added 5 pieces of content. Delivering significant value to Profile, ACME, Salary Calculator, Resume Review, and ITA ([dashboard](https://go.indeed.com/GLYCA8RXF)).  
* **Job Card Service grew from a single instance to 5 pages across 5 products**, enabling a consistent user experience and the ability to easily run experiments across products.  
  * Example of improved metrics: \+0.61 pO, 50%+ increase in click-through rates on various apply flows ([source](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/INDAPP-2614?focusedCommentId=16701672&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16701672))  
* **JSFE able to migrate off legacy soy code** by leveraging the Node.js Rendering Service for server side rendering.  
  * HP completely migrated off soy ([HOMEPAGE-2166](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/HOMEPAGE-2166)). JSFE Platform deleted over [50K lines and 70 files](https://go.indeed.com/IQLKG8C2Z4); now are 90% server side rendering react, enabling faster DLT and UXDs to contribute to the VJ page  
* [**Global Settings**](http://passp-774) **launched at 100% in US**. Powered by Mosaic for autonomous delivery of each page.  
* **Docked messaging** ([MSGP-997](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/MSGP-997), [UX](https://bugs.indeed.com/secure/attachment/1916884/Dock_V1.png)) \- 100% worldwide minus GB  
  * [\+1.2%](https://go.indeed.com/IQLFX2XM38) JS w/ a message sent ([\+0.02%](https://go.indeed.com/IQL2YYHT8Y) global impact)  
* **Employer Center launched internal beta**, including new header and left nav variants developed 100% via external contribution. First example of an external team taking full ownership of GNav content.

# **Code Contribution exec+**

* **GNav Job Seeker Aurora header redesign** ([GNAV-683](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAV-683))  
  * Drove initial planning and technical strategy to convert header to IFL for the first time; created initial tickets & skeleton to get team started  
  * Implemented CSS style prefixing plugin necessary to prevent host CSS from affecting the GNav header. This was a complex and critical feature. ([GNAVS-3425](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3425))  
  * Added automated Cypress coverage ([GNAVS-3028](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3028))  
* **GNav Push-on-Green to 100%** ([GNAV-647](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAV-647))  
  * init+ Evan was critical in stabilizing the GNav deploy pipeline, finding ways to resolve errors and make the pipeline more resilient to failures outside of our control ([GNAV-738](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAV-738))  
  * Optimized deploy pipeline to skip unnecessary steps when changes were only made to automated tests, allowing us to close those tickets faster and unblock other deploys in the queue ([GNAVS-3482](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3482))  
  * Added team Slack notification when test failures are blocking a pipeline ([GNAVS-3466](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3466))  
  * Contributed to filling in automated coverage gaps ([5 tickets](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=key%20in%20%28GNAVS-3797%2CGNAVS-3405%2CGNAVS-3112%2CGNAVS-3257%2CGNAVS-3651%29%20order%20by%20updated%20desc))  
* **SME on index builders, especially Spark-based builders**  
  * Implemented new globalPagePerformance Spark index builder ([GNAVS-2878](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-2878), [GNAVS-3888](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3888))  
  * Paired on globalDwellTime Spark index builder with SWE2. Instrumental in getting over some complex hurdles and coordinating with external devs to improve Indeed Spark commons.  
  * Paired with SWE2 to make further index builder improvements, resolving an issue with missing data ([GNAVS-2996](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-2996))  
  * Hands-on help/advice on external contributions to GNav index builders ([3 tickets](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=key%20in%20%28GNAVS-3275%2CGNAVS-3682%2CGNAVS-3400%29%20order%20by%20updated%20desc))  
  * *"Your Spark work continues to pay dividends, since it's allowed us to create more Spark indexes using your index builders as a template, and also knowing that we can rely on you for expertise/guidance" \-TF4*  
* **Reduce Global Nav's impact on page performance**  
  * Added check at build time to fail if static assets exceed a threshold, preventing contributors from accidentally inflating bundle size ([GNAVS-3181](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3181))  
  * Developed a proof-of-concept for dynamically importing modules at runtime, unblocking CreateAccountFlyout external contribution, which would have increased bundle size by \~60%, by ([GNAVS-3255](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3255))  
    * *"With his help, we were able to unstick the feature and turn the test back on in production." \-External SWE2*  
* **Quickly turned around fixes to help mitigate two EVNTs**  
  * Identified issue with stale GNav fallback content, and quickly resolved by adding versioning capability ([EVNT-2882](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/EVNT-2882), [GNAVS-3260](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3260))  
  * Deployed Passport continue param sanitization to mobile header and footers ([EVNT-2093](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/EVNT-2093), [GNAVS-3367](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3367), [GNAVS-3381](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-3381))  
* **Mosaic IFL Support:** Leveraging the CSS prefixing work for GNav, delivered support for IFL in Mosaic Providers via skeleton example and [documentation](https://wiki.indeed.com/display/Mosaic/Using+IFL+in+a+Mosaic+provider). This allows providers to adopt Aurora branding. ([MOSPLAT-1873](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/MOSPLAT-1873))  
* **Greatly simplified GNav integration code**, reducing service config to 3 lines of code and adding more flexibility for us to to deploy changes to hosts without requiring code changes ([GNAVS-2836](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-2836))  
* **Drove proof-of-concept to convert Employer GNav header to IFL**, which will support Aurora branding, code reorganization to support platformization, and cleanup of legacy components. ([GNAV-760](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAV-760))  
* **Drove investigation determining the cause of elevated CPU throughout cmhprod**. Freed up 9 m5a.16xl instances in prod, saving \~$14k per month (more if you include QA, more as products migrate into cmhprod).  
* **Code cleanup & maintainability**. Cleaned up several old tests, reduced boilerplate duplicated for every GNav variant, and more. ([7 tickets](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=key%20in%20%28GNAVS-3222%2CGNAVS-3878%2CGNAVS-3905%2CGNAVS-3906%2CGNAVS-3183%2CGNAVS-2885%2CGNAVS-3260%29%20order%20by%20updated%20desc))  
* Hands-on in diagnosing a particularly hairy and confusing performance issue with Node.js Rendering Service right before the December code freeze. Was able to resolve the issue in collaboration with other SMEs, fixing two issues with observability along the way ([NODESSR-164](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NODESSR-164), [NODESSR-165](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NODESSR-165))

# **Product Direction**

* Active and engaged participant in annual & quarterly team planning: brought many (big) ideas to brainstorming, thought critically about proposals/direction, asked thoughtful questions

# **Mentorship impact+ init+**

* Extremely available and willing to help pair with teammates, get them unblocked, and help them grow as engineers. Based on **many** examples from peer feedback, both teammates and other Indeedians  
* Proactively setup appointment blocks for pairing, allowing teammates to schedule time as needed  
* SME for effectively every aspect of our stack  
* *"...he is intentional about sharing what he knows and helping his teammates be more effective engineers. He blocks off several hours in his calendar each week for pairing...I feel like I become a better engineer just by watching how Evan works" \-SWE2 teammate*  
* Paired with Analytics tools SWE2 to deliver FullStory functionality ([FS-23](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/FS-23))  
  * *"Evan has been a huge help with the effort to integrate FullStory with Global Navigation. ...His knowledge of everything GNAV related has helped connect us to other efforts related to our goals. ...Evan is very responsive to my ad-hoc requests. His swift actions have kept me unblocked several times."*

# **Delivery Process**

* Evan played a critical role in getting GNav to full Push-on-Green. In addition to the Code Contributions covered above, Evan was a leader in shifting team mindset and focus to meet our goal  
* Added color indicators to our Jira Board to notate when a ticket was marked for PoG or not

# **Technical Architecture**

* [Implementation plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PQX07IADaIMzZh0yRq7MDgRujWB9kRLQUel9zSGh-M/edit#heading=h.c770h5mkpx6u) for converting the Job Seeker header to Aurora/IFL. Iterated based on team feedback & technical discovery  
* [Drove consensus](https://code.corp.indeed.com/frontend/mosaic-platform/-/merge_requests/44#note_5094017) on enabling CloudFront compression (including brotli) company-wide. This is expected to reduce JS & CSS asset sizes by 5-20% for 90% of CSS & JS downloads across Indeed.  
* Collaborated on [GNav/Mosaic delivery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1956D7aDCMW8SrZrUnA2m4UX18YOye8U7xZAurVV5I6c/edit#heading=h.198vyt25njrr) and [GNav Autonomy/Platformization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15f-7eDLVdTeM7aj0awkGLSPyUTIiWZHEuMCciIs49x4/edit) technical direction. Provided insight and research to help guide strategy  
  * *"You were an effective collaborator for technical direction-setting. For example, you provided a strong alternative perspective on ownership-sharing strategies that challenged the way \[we\] were thinking about things, which helped us dig deeper into some of our assumptions" \-TF4*  
* Key participant in discussions with the SMB OneHost team about integrating with GNav  
* Gave feedback on [GNav external link configuration proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FJl6hXJe1Dsy12aAlWw19FtYsFvkwmkCmBaDeYwYo9Q/edit#)

# **Other Contribution**

* Drove investigation of [EVNT-3055](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/EVNT-3055) (employer header not interactive for some users)  
* Investigated what appears to be spikes in failure rates during GNav deploys. Determined this was mostly a misinterpretation of our DataDog dashboard, and resolved with more accurate/intuitive charts.  
* Supported FullStory integration team, and then quickly remove FullStory integration due to legal concerns.

#### **Next Steps**

Continuing the discussions we've been having: work with your manager to more clearly define the role you've been naturally fitting into. Consider setting some aspirational goals for the next two quarters on how you might leverage that role to have even more impact on the team.

#### **Career Focus**

Other developers on the team see you as a leader and mentor, which means you are constantly leading by example, even when not trying. Think about how you can leverage this to be a force multiplier on the team.
