GNav is a platform that operates as a multi-tenant codebase. GM-specific teams (e.g. JSFE, SMB) own header nav content, while the majority of contributions are external (e.g. Passport team wants to run a test for a different sign-in mechanism).

* 1 of 2 developers focused on GNav  
* Maintained exceptional customer support (\#global-nav) despite [increasing incoming volume](https://squall.indeed.com/iqlweb/#q[]=FROM%20statsbot%202021-10-01%202022-03-31%0AWHERE%20channel%3D'global-nav'%20event%3D'message'%0AGROUP%20BY%20time%281mo%29%0ASELECT&author=mbulman&createTimestamp=1648229032&v=2&view=plot). Significant time investment, including hands-on help and issues that are not always GNav-specific (e.g. general frontend help) ([satisfaction survey results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kHR4Te0ZHZ3iuz3eP6uJjOxXYzbwN48Kjtho6MWH_C0/edit#responses))  
* Evan is always eager and willing to jump on threads or tasks that help get customers unblocked  
* Notable platform improvements include: integrating with bundle-stats reporter, stabilizing and improving Cypress test suite and reporting ([jql](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=key%20in%20%28gnavs-5596%2C%20gnavs-5603%2C%20gnavs-5686%2C%20gnavs-5501%2C%20gnavs-5740%2C%20gnavs-5933%2C%20gnavs-5936%2C%20gnavs-5999%29%20order%20by%20updated%20desc))  
* Notable customer efforts include: Google Analytics centralized delivery (addresses critical legal requirement), significant hands-on review for employer phone verification banner, modal-based sign-in, employer self-help module, unblocking /hire one-tap rollout by changing the way the integration is loaded ([GNAVS-5645](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-5645))  
* **Impact:** GNav serves both critical UI and delivers functionality across every product at Indeed from a centralized location. This enables teams to much more easily meet legal requirements, understand our users better, and improve business metrics.

Customer Feedback

* *"Evan was a helpful code reviewer and collaborator throughout the process of developing graphQL endpoints in globalnav-service...He helped me to make the code fit in more cohesively with the rest of the service and to think about long term impacts."*  
* *"Evan was super helpful ...He taught me a lot about the technical details of gnav and was always able to answer my questions. He also reviewed many of my merge requests and helped me to investigate and deploy bug fixes quickly, notably one that happened pretty late on a Friday. I am thankful for all the time he spent helping me this last semester."*  
* *"One thing I really appreciate about Evan is pursuit of quality code. He pushes merge request authors to make different/better decisions in code authoring. ...He gave great feedback to push my ticket along."*

### GNav IFLv4 upgrades and A/B testing JavaScript dependencies

Requirement to roll out this upgrade as a per-variant experiment to ensure no-harm.

* Developed mechanism/pattern for A/B testing JavaScript dependencies in Global Nav  
* Extra complexity in supporting server- and client-side with federated modules. Created [@indeed/frontend-webpack-sharing-resolver](https://code.corp.indeed.com/frontend/webpack-sharing-resolver) library to manage module federation complexity  
  * *"oh this is hype."* \-SMB SWE3 (Indeedâ€™s other Module Federation SME)  
* Privacy team followed pattern for OneTrust integration \- which can only be tested in production \- finally enabling safe rollouts to production behind proctor.  
* Implemented and drove test to upgraded Job Seeker header and employer footers to IFL v4, safely and confidently via A/B testing mechanism mentioned above ([GNAV-961](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAV-961))  
* SSR tottime \-33% (p50 from 12ms to 8ms, p95 from 18ms to 12ms) ([IQL](https://link.indeed.tech/IQLC748WF))  
* **Impact**: Because GNav serves critical UI across every product at Indeed, the ability to safely roll out dependency upgrades ensures teams can move faster safely and avoid languishing on old versions.

### Global Nav Operational Excellence

Evan consistently found opportunities to keep GNav running smoothly.

* Dramatically reduced GNav javascript error volume, which was preventing some user interactions ([GNAVS-5778](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-5778))  
  * Reduced sporadic CORS errors by \~75% (1.145% \-\> 0.306% of gnav requests; 1,729,167 to 463,963; [IQL](https://link.indeed.tech/IQLTE76ZM))  
  * Issue investigation led to discovering oddity in CloudFront CDN. Filed and drove very involved AWS support case, resulting in an S3 bug being filed  
  * Coordinated with SRE to change Indeed CDN config to workaround the issue ([SRE-7308](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/SRE-7308))  
  * This would have prevented [EVNT-3335](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/EVNT-3335) & [EVNT-2292](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/EVNT-2292) and probably many of [these 34 Bugs](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=text%20~%20%22crossorigin%22%20AND%20type%3DBug) from teams across Indeed  
  * *"One callout is the never give up spirit that Evan has. We were suffered by the CORS issue for 4+ months. However, it's very hard to reproduce the error and the probability to impact end-users was also low, nobody but Evan was head down on solving this solution. The consistent effort of making product great is the thing I admire of Evan."* \-SRE  
* Use production React build instead of dev (Indeed-wide problem discovered by external TF5) ([GNAVS-5883](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-5883))  
  * Request p50 improved by 35% (12ms-\>8ms), p95 improved by 28% (17ms-\>12ms) ([IQL](https://link.indeed.tech/IQL3XTFHG))  
* Added retries for loading JS assets in the browder ([GNAVS-5444](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-5444))  
* Investigate disparate performance characteristics in SJC/IAD ([GNAVS-6050](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-6050))  
  * Added more granular observability for render times to help ([GNAVS-6095](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-6095))  
* Reduce proctor log spam about accountId \-1 ([GNAVS-5498](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-5498))  
* Migrate QA instances to CMHQA ([GNAVS-6086](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/GNAVS-6086))

*"Evan went the extra mile this quarter and lent his expertise to help the Scheduling and Availability team diagnose web performance issues. He analyzed our code in-context with the Resume team's application as well as in Storybook, and brought a number of good ideas to the table. What's more, he took time out of his schedule to pair with me at length on several occasions, to walk through possible causes and remedies."* \-UX Dev

*"Only after rotating onto a new team do I realize how spoiled I was to work with SWE's like Evan on GNAV. Evan is quick to help in troubleshooting problems and is always available to help theorycraft new strategies on how best to tweak the GNAV Cypress suite. ...Evan is incredibly proactive in thinking of how best quality assurance can be implemented into a product, and it truly shows."* \-QAAE2 teammate

#### **Calculated PTL**

#### **Next Steps and Career Focus**

* We've talked about delivering through others in the past, but that can be difficult on a small, senior team where everyone is aiming to lead initiatives. Work with your manager to decide if this is an area of growth you're actively interested in, and best next steps \- whether that's finding opportunities to exercise/grow that skill or ways to otherwise increase impact.  
* You have great technical ideas and don't hesitate to dive right into implementation. There *may* be recent examples where you finish that implementation and the work was not totally worth the higher-than-expected effort. Think about what impact you expect an initiative to have, plan how that work will play out, and especially how you can understand impact and ROI early and iteratively
