### **impact+ exec+ Major Team Accomplishments/Metrics**

* Able to introduce new questions without needing deployments of any code outside of IQ \-- huge impact reducing time to add new questions. (hours of dev time per question vs. 1.5 months per question in 2016\)  
  * Worked with SMB, JSFE, & Ricky teams to define [requirements & design](https://wiki.indeed.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=100831372) for job description appendix  
  * Proposed solution for parameter map and broke down sub-project into [tasks](http://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=parent%3DNIGMA-1111)  
  * Prioritized proctor-based question onboarding in order to make the release of new questions safe and provided valuable [design](https://wiki.indeed.com/display/SQ/Onboard+And+Deprecate+Requirement+Types+With+Proctor) feedback  
* Question suggestions to employers:  
  * 32% improvement (from [50% to 66%](https://go.indeed.com/IQLGGGNMNW)) acceptance rate, with repeated title at 90% accept rate  
  * 38% improvement (from [40% to 55%](https://go.indeed.com/IQLMXMCWMR)) in international suggestions  
* Improved auto reject functionality to ignore soft requirements  
  * [10%](https://go.indeed.com/IQL9EW7W7K) of questions added are soft  
  * [12%](https://go.indeed.com/IQLH6CKK3T) auto reject adoption overall  
  * [15%](https://go.indeed.com/IQLHT69FNZ) adoption when soft requirements are available  
  * Loyal team has demonstrated that auto reject adoption is associated with increased advertiser spend  
* Learned we could add Job detail questions, prep for Q4  
  * Collected [224k](https://go.indeed.com/IQLPHCYP8D) answers to new Job detail questions with minimal impact on [conversions](https://go.indeed.com/IQLRAHHCG3)  
  * Helped solidify this vision, including profile-based applies and the blurry line between job details & qualifications ("A background check will be performed on applicants" versus "Verify that applicants are willing to undergo a background check")  
* Added first multi-select Job Seeker question (shift availability) \-- paves the way for smarter automated sourcing

  * Prioritized job-seeker side in order to provide business impact earlier  
  * Provided coaching on the design approach to multi-select  
  * Gave early guidance on how to write the design doc  
* Continued high apply-time availability

  * Handled over 0.5B job apply requests with better than five 9s of availability [IQL](https://go.indeed.com/IQLKYHA329)

### **impact+ exec+ Mentorship and Best Practices**

* Managed team composed of 1 intern, 4 SWEs, 1 Data Scientist, 1 PM, 1 rotating PM, 1 rotating TDM, 1 rotating SWE, 1 UX designer  
  * Weekly 1:1 meetings with all for coaching, product planning, etc.  
    * Quote from Desiree Poland, Dev: *"Our 1:1s have helped me with prioritization for my career growth, and increasing my knowledge and understanding of our product."*  
  * Mitigated the negative impact of a rotator's poor culture fit and unprofessional behavior  
  * 1 Level up (SWE0 \=\> SWE1)  
  * Improved performance of low-performing team-member:  
    * Provided mentorship around incremental delivery and how to avoid blocking teammates  
      * provided example via initial breakdown of [NIGMA-1111](https://bugs.indeed.com/issues/?jql=parent%3DNIGMA-1111), a major component of the team's primary initiative  
      * recent CRs have gone much more smoothly than CRs from early in the quarter with an even bigger difference when compared to last quarter ([crucible](https://fisheye.indeed.com/cru/?filter=custom&title=&project=&author=ywang&moderator=ywang&creator=ywang&reviewer=&complete=any&reviewType=any&orRoles=true&state=Closed&sort=review&order=desc))  
    * Work is delivered much more incrementally, with much less rewriting  
    * Communication/coordination with other team-members has improved significantly  
    * Peer feedback shows that other team-members are now much happier to work with the SWE in question  
* Introduced processes & tracking tools that provide visibility while maintaining team engagement ([IQ Goals page](https://wiki.indeed.com/display/SQ/Goals))  
* Initiated (and participated in) team-internal design review process ([IQ design docs](https://wiki.indeed.com/display/SQ/Design+Docs))  
* Participated in design review in related areas  
  * Dradis PIE ([doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16MS_wrElLqRccvzGaZAcE4IySb--l4LRWiJbjuxBDMk))  
  * Dradis Job Wizard Plugin Pages ([doc](https://docs.google.com/a/indeed.com/document/d/1_hkRs0vdtCyVJvfEfcyR1iRMbrhczK8Y2Y4WmnM7ahQ/edit?usp=drive_web))

### **Individual Contributions**

* Cross-team coordination with a large list of teams, including Dradis Jobs, Dradis Backend, CPQA, Resume:Profile, ProfIO, Match, & ITA  
* [Emergency fix](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-1220) for incorrect auto-reject behavior  
* Fix production [NPE](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/NIGMA-1293)

### **impact+ Recruiting**

* 19 interview events  
  * Shadowed 1 and led (with reverse shadow) 6 architecture interviews  
  * Led 7 industry tech phone screens  
  * Shadowed 1 and led 4 whiteboard interviews

#### **Next Steps**

* We've got a long list of potential Q4 objectives, including a major UI rev, Dradis platform integration, MyIndeed needs, major surgery on Job Details, and challenges around question utility measurement. Focus on good prioritization followed by strong, incremental execution. Consider having multiple SWEs swarm on tasks, rather than have them operating with complete independence.  
* With support from me, address any remaining performance concerns with Yue and get him into solid meets territory

#### **Career Focus**

* Get to lead as an Architecture Interviewer.  
* Continue to participate in design reviews for teams outside your immediate product area.  
* Let's explore any remaining gaps in your SWE3 levelup

#### **Overall Rating**

Exceeds Expectations
