**Narrative**: Evan is a foundational technical leader whose work has reshaped how Indeed delivers and measures performance at scale. He architected and led the complex IFL7 dual-building and A/B testing effort across multiple product surfaces, directly enabling a seamless, risk-mitigated rollout of one of Jobseeker’s most ambitious frontend upgrades. His deep technical rigor, mentorship, and ability to teach investigative and debugging skills have meaningfully upskilled engineers across organizations. Additionally, this cycle, he delivered an 8% improvement in homepage site speed—an achievement that was recognized and celebrated at the VP level. Beyond his project impact, Evan continues to elevate the broader engineering culture by championing AI-driven productivity initiatives.

*“Evan is an incredibly powerful software engineer. He is a fundamental pillar of the US-Web team.”* **\- Andrew Soldini, PM**
