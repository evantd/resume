## Experience

### Indeed, Seattle, WA

At Indeed, I grew my leadership, mentorship, architecture, and frontend skills. I gave management a try for a couple years. The work felt valuable & important, but I missed the satisfaction and day-to-day feelings of accomplishment that come with individual contribution. When transitioning back from management to IC work, I took the opportunity to change domains and learn new skills by moving to a frontend-focused team.

* improve automated testing and streamline release processes in order to achieve full push-on-green CI/CD
* provide a platform for delivering non-UI capabilities (e.g. observability, cookie compliance, etc.) across all Indeed products
* improve performance of data analysis pipeline by >10x while also improving correctness
* improve performance impact & safety of global navigation header, including reducing initial bundle size by 48%, improving isolation, and using module federation to enable dependency sharing
* quickly investigate & address high severity production issues
* advise & mentor teammates and other engineers across the company

### Amazon, Seattle, WA

In my decade at Amazon, I grew into a full-stack developer, owning (gathering requirements, designing, developing, monitoring, & maintaining) libraries, services, DB schemas, distributed systems, websites, & single-page apps. I demonstrated leadership by mentoring interns & junior engineers, leading to hires and promotions. Furthermore, I was liked and respected by my peers and customers due to my tact, CS fundamentals, quality-focus, breadth of knowledge of company-wide systems, and ability to dive deep & resolve complex/hidden root causes even in unfamiliar systems.

#### Software Development Engineer (Developer Productivity Tools) - December 2006 to July 2015

In reverse-chronological order:

* Worked as part of a team to implement a code browser (think "GitHub for Amazon") with innovative features such as "always-on blame", visual DAGs, elegant client-side change views, commenting, and pull-requests. *Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, Java, Git, NoSQL (DynamoDB)*
* Worked as part of team to implement highly available, horizontally scalable revision control, supporting >300k Git repositories for >10k developers. *Java, Distributed Systems, Git, Oracle*

* Led a team to implement a system supporting company-wide continuous deployment, modelling and automating ~40k release processes. *Java, Ruby on Rails, Oracle*
* Improved deployment scheduling algorithm from O(n^3) to O(n^2), allowing Amazon to scale deployment capacity to handle Q4 loads, allowing development to continue and potentially saving many millions of dollars.
* Owned internal revision control systems, including implementation of monitoring, throttling, and a hot standby system. The depth of understanding I was able to reverse-engineer allowed Amazon to terminate their support contract with Perforce, saving ~$1M per year. *Perforce, Perl*
