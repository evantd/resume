## Experience

### Indeed, Seattle, WA

At Indeed, I grew my design skills as well as my leadership & mentorship skills.

#### Lead Software Engineer (Questions team) - August 2015 to present

Leadership:
* Worked with product management to collaboratively define data-driven quarterly goals.
* Led a team of 6 engineers to track & meet those goals.
* Helped team-members develop their skills and advance their careers.
* Participated constructively in design reviews
* Interviewed candidates in coding/problem-solving interviews as well as architecture interviews.

Individual Contributions:
* Demonstrated proof-of-concept for increasing job requirement suggestion acceptance rate by 15%.
* Designed & implemented client-focused data-driven API to help decouple client & service changes.
* Introduced numerous best-practices and tools to reduce coding errors (Immutables, Jackson, Fongo, Checkstyle, Spring-Data-MongoDB, AssertJ, etc.), and guided teams across the company in their use.
* Dug deep into other teams' code in order to address production issues as well as internal productivity issues.

### Amazon, Seattle, WA

In my decade at Amazon, I grew into a full-stack developer, owning (gathering requirements, designing, developing, monitoring, & maintaining) libraries, services, DB schemas, distributed systems, websites, & single-page apps. I demonstrated leadership by mentoring interns & junior engineers, leading to hires and promotions. Furthermore, I was liked and respected by my peers and customers due to my tact, CS fundamentals, quality-focus, breadth of knowledge of company-wide systems, and ability to dive deep & resolve complex/hidden root causes even in unfamiliar systems.

#### Software Development Engineer (Developer Productivity Tools) - December 2006 to July 2015

In reverse-chronological order:
* Worked as part of a team to implement a code browser (think "GitHub for Amazon") with innovative features such as "always-on blame", visual DAGs, elegant client-side change views, commenting, and pull-requests. *Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, Java, Git, NoSQL (DynamoDB)*
* Worked as part of team to implement highly available, horizontally scalable revision control, currently supporting >300k Git repositories for >10k developers. *Java, Distributed Systems, Git, Oracle*
* Designed & built an authorization system to model access control while abstracting the backend in order to protect clients from changes in a space that has historically shown substantial volatility.
* Led a team to implement a system supporting company-wide continuous deployment, modelling and automating ~40k release processes. *Java, Ruby on Rails, Oracle*
* Improved deployment scheduling algorithm from O(n^3) to O(n^2), allowing Amazon to scale deployment capacity to handle Q4 loads, allowing development to continue and potentially saving many millions of dollars.
* Owned internal revision control systems, including implementation of monitoring, throttling, and a hot standby system. The depth of understanding I was able to reverse-engineer allowed Amazon to terminate their support contract with Perforce, saving ~$1M per year. *Perforce, Perl*
* Owned multiple generations of internal code review systems, including gathering requirements and designing features. The latest generation handles ~6k CRs per day and serves >10k users across the company. *Python, Java, Perl/Mason, MySQL*

#### Software Development Engineer (Ordering) - March 2005 to December 2006

* Owned reporting and improving stuck/delayed order metrics, including coordinating with other teams to resolve root causes.
* Owned marketplace seller order management used by all Amazon sellers (both backend services and web frontends). *Java, C++, Perl/Mason, Oracle*
