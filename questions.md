## Questions For You

I ask what I suspect are some unusual questions about potential positions in order to help decide if the job & I are a good match. Here's a sample of the sort of thing you should be prepared for:
* How big is the software engineering organization? How big is the Seattle office?
* How do you support collaboration within & between offices?
* What does the tech stack looks like? What are the main values driving those tech choices?
* What does the build/deploy/provisioning infrastructure look like, and what values drive those processes?
* What business & technical problems are being solved? Who are the primary customers/users/stakeholders?
* What forms does mentorship and support for career growth take?
* What do the review, promotion, and raise processes look like?
* Can you share attrition/retention rates?
* How do you encourage diversity in the workplace?
* What shape is the compensation package? That is, what proportion of total compensation tends to be covered by salary, bonuses, & stocks?
* What is your PTO policy?
* What is your policy regarding personal projects & open source?

## Salary Range

Current breakdown:
* $185k base
* 18% quarterly bonuses
* LTIPs vesting at $40-70k per year
