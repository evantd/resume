## Questions For You

I ask what I suspect are some unusual questions about potential positions in order to help decide if the job & I are a good match. Here's a sample of the sort of thing you should be prepared for:
* Can you sponsor a New Zealand visa?
* How big is the software engineering organization?
* How do you support remote workers?
* Which cities have offices, and how big are they?
* How do you support collaboration within & between locations?
* What does the tech stack looks like? What are the main values driving those tech choices?
* What does the build/deploy/provisioning infrastructure look like, and what values drive those processes?
* What business & technical problems are being solved? Who are the primary customers/users/stakeholders?
* What forms does mentorship and support for career growth take?
* What do the review, promotion, and raise processes look like?
* Can you share attrition/retention rates?
* How do you encourage diversity in the workplace?
* What shape is the compensation package? That is, what proportion of total compensation tends to be covered by salary, bonuses, & stocks/LTIPs/equity?
* What is your PTO policy?
* What is your policy regarding personal projects & open source?

## Salary Range
I'm currently earning >$300k/year, and I'm happy in my current position, so a compelling offer would need to beat that by a significant margin while also providing an excellent work environment with great opportunities & support for growth. I may entertain reduced monetary compensation in exchange for New Zealand visa sponsorship.

Current breakdown:
* $211,140 base
* 10% quarterly bonuses (or more)
* LTIPs vesting at >$120k per year
* RSUs vesting at >$65k
